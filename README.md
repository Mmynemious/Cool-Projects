# Cool-Projects
Things I found while scraping the internet. Hope you find some inspiration

These are random projects I found that would be coll to replicate and share with the world. Although I am a beginner (and mistakes will be often found in my code) it is still a fun activity to pursue. If I can get better at coding, I will definetly try out some computational drug discovery projects.
